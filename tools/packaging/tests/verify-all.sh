# Run the whole packaging verification suite over one directory of artifacts.
#
# Usage: verify-all.sh <dir> [version]
#
#   WITH <version>    -- the RELEASE path. Every artifact is named EXPLICITLY, so
#                        a missing or misnamed file fails here rather than being
#                        waved through by a glob that happened to match nothing.
#                        The release directory also holds the macOS tarball.
#   WITHOUT <version> -- the BUILD path. The caller does not know the version the
#                        artifact names carry, so the safe globs documented below
#                        are used instead. The linux build artifact contains no
#                        macOS tarball, hence no macOS check in this mode.
#
# THE GLOB RULE -- the reason this lives in ONE file: never hand verify-tgz.sh a
# bare `wire-cdt-*.tar.gz`. That pattern globs the linux and macOS tarballs
# together and the verifier silently checks whichever one sorted first, so a
# broken tarball can ship having "passed". Every tarball pattern here is
# ARCH-SUFFIXED, and the base rpm is matched as `wire-cdt-[0-9]*` so the `-dev`
# rpm can never be picked up in its place.
