### jsoncons::json_serializing_options

```c++
typedef basic_json_serializing_options<char> json_serializing_options
```

Specifies options for serializing and deserializing JSON text. The `json_serializing_options` class is an instantiation of the `basic_json_serializing_options` class template that uses `char` as the character type.

The default floating point formatting for a floating point value that was previously decoded from json text is to preserve the original format and precision. This ensures round-trip for both format and precision, e.g. 1.1 read will remain `1.1` when written, and not become `1.1000000000000001` (an equivalent but longer representation.)
