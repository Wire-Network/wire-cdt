### jsonpath extension

The jsonpath extension implements [Stefan Goessner's JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).  

It provides functions for search and "search and replace" using JSONPath expressions:

[json_query](json_query.md)

[json_replace](json_replace.md)

The [Jayway JSONPath Evaluator](https://jsonpath.herokuapp.com/) and [JSONPATH Expression Tester](https://jsonpath.curiousconcept.com/)
are good online evaluators for checking JSONPath expressions.
    
### Stefan Goessner's JSONPath

[JSONPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) is a creation of Stefan Goessner. JSONPath expressions refer to a JSON text in the same way as XPath expressions refer to an XML document. 

Stefan Goessner's javascript implemention returns `false` in case of no match, but in a note he suggests an alternative is to return an empty array. The `jsoncons` implementation takes that alternative and returns an empty array in case of no match.

Unlike XML, the root of a JSON text is usually an anonymous object or array, so JSONPath identifies the outermost level of the text with the symbol $.
